/**
 * Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.
 *
 * Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.
 *
 * Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.
 *
 * Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
 * Output: 4
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
 * Output: 30
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
 * Output: 23
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= piles.length <= 104
 * piles.length <= h <= 109
 * 1 <= piles[i] <= 109
